# This configuration file maintains all the community-supported sets of 
# namelist options. To build a namelist for one of these configurations, 
# use the Python helper script ush/set_namelist.py and provide this file
# and the desired section via the -c option.

# The FV3_GSD_v0 section is empty as it provides the "base namelist" to 
# which all the modifications here are provided. Please see 
#   ush/templates/input.nml.FV3
# for the full set of namelist options that are used for FV3 in that 
# configuration.
